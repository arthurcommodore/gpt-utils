        "description": "__Height:__ 179.2cm (5'10.6\")\n\nMinato Namikaze was the Fourth Hokage of Konohagakure and the man responsible for sealing the nine-tailed demon fox inside Naruto Uzumaki when he was born. Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand.!~",

        "description": "\nKimimaro was the fifth member of the Sound Four, thus temporarily changing their group name to the Sound Five. The original four were forced to accept him against their will, as Kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.  NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.  Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\n\nLike many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~! Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.!~  ",

When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

He himself was hailed as the \"God of Shinobi\" for his unmatched ninja prowess. Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan. In his early years, after they and their clans had been fighting constantly, he had his clan allied with Uchiha Madara, and the two of them, with their clans, founded Konoha. Later on, Madara left the village over the policies of the village and his clan. This conflict resulted in battle with Uchiha Madara and the nine-tailed fox at the Valley of the End. To commemorate the battle, two statues of Madara and Hashirama were carved into the earth around the waterfall. However the war still waged on, and unsure of the title of Hokage he would not only appoint his brother as his successor as the Second Hokage (Nidaime Hokage), but in a common decision with his brother they also decided that one of their students Sarutobi should become the Third Hokage (Sandaime Hokage), which in turn seemed like a wise decision as both brothers would eventually die during the wars. \n\nHe was most famous for his unique Wood Release techniques, a kekkei genkai that is a mixture of earth and water-natured chakra that creates this new element. By converting chakra into the source of life, he was able to create trees, causing them to grow to great sizes and manipulate them to diverse shapes and battle uses at will. In an instant, he could shape the entire battlefield for his own uses. \n\n(Source: Narutopedia)",

Anko was once the student of Orochimaru. Later she, along with nine others, were branded with Orochimaru\u0026#039;s first ten samples of the Cursed Seal of Heaven. Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn\u0026#039;t tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.    Anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways. Despite portraying several \u0026quot;Naruto-like\u0026quot; habits, she has shown to be very knowledgeable and studious.     However, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched Naruto\u0026#039;s face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place. As shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. From there on, Anko continues to search for Orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.",

Naruto soon rescues the boy while returning from a mission and sidetracking to get a \u0026quot;legendary fermented bamboo\u0026quot; for Ichiraku Ramen and takes him back to Konoha to recover, while there giving him the nickname Menma (which means fermented bamboo).

        "description": "__Height__: 147.3 cm-148.3 cm (I); 160 cm (II)  \n__Ninja Registration Nº__: 012612  \n__Rank__: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)  \n__Likes__: Naruto, zenzai(sweet red-bean soup), cinnamon rolls, pressing flowers  \n__Dislikes__: Crab, shrimp  \n\nHyuuga Hinata is the eldest daughter of the Hyuga clan's main branch. \"Hyuga\" (日向) means \"toward the sun\" while \"Hinata\" is a pun, as it is another way to read this kanji and means \"a sunny place\". Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.  In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto's words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.  Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō?), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.",

Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins.  For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes.

She takes part in a fake battle with them to win the trust of Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya, who tend to her after rescuing her. While she has her clothes off inside a room, Naruto is being shown attempting to peek at the nude Sasame until Sakura notices him and hits him on the head. After they come out, Naruto is surpised and wondering who Sasame is, at which time Sakura informs Naruto that Sasame and the mystery ninja they picked up are the same person. Ironically, this causes Naruto to realize that he accidently groped Sasame when he rescued her before. At that time Sakura strikes him on the head again for daydreaming something perverted and the group is attacked by the previous ninja group, who turn out to be members of the Fūma. After with fighting the other Fūma again, she leads the three to Orochimaru\u0026#039;s lair. When she did locate the lair, she ended up in a rope trap where she persuaded the three to let her help in exchange for seeing Arashi.  Sasame planned on giving Naruto, Jiraiya and Sakura tea with a drug to make them fall asleep, and handing them over to Kamikiri in exchange for being allowed to see Arashi. However, the plan failed when Kamikiri revealed that he wanted to kill them instead of capturing them, and Sasame was knocked unconscious when she protested against that. Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya revealed that they had only pretended to go along with her plan, and defeated the three Fūma ninja. Almost as soon as she regained consciousness, Sasame tried to commit suicide over having failed, but Jiraiya stopped her and convinced her to show them to the hideout.  Despite being ordered to stay behind, Sasame follows Naruto into the hideout and saves him from a slowly flooding room by opening the trapdoor, allowing him to catch up with Sakura. She later saves Naruto from Kagerō (who was disguised as Kabuto Yakushi) by giving Sakura a seal that will free them from her attack. When she met Arashi, she saw what had become of her cousin she decided to help Naruto and Sakura in defeating him. After the incident, she decided to join forces with Hanzaki and the remaining members of the Fūma clan to rebuild the clan\u0026#039;s former glory.!~",

        "description": "__Height__: 170 cm\n__Rank__: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)\n\nShikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work. This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements.",

He deeply cares for Akamaru, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect him. And, despite his rather gruff attitude, many of Kiba's actions reveal that he is very close to his older sister, Hana Inuzuka, and remains fiercely loyal to the Inuzuka clan. Kiba's personality and jutsu style are further enhanced by his wild appearance. While clearly human, he has several physical traits more akin to animals. Like the rest of his clan, he has messy brown hair, sharp black eyes with vertical slit-like pupils, pronounced canine teeth, and nails that he can change into claws.

Konohamaru usually hangs out with his two friends, Udon and Moegi. Together, they call themselves the \"Konohamaru Corps\" (\"Konohamaru Ninja Squad\" in the English dub). \n\nIn Part II they are teamed together under the leadership of Ebisu, Konohamaru's former tutor.  At the start of the series, Konohamaru feels unacknowledged due to his status as the Hokage's grandson. As such, he frequently attempts to defeat his grandfather in battle so that he can become Hokage himself and earn the recognition he desires. Once meeting Naruto Uzumaki, Konohamaru realizes that he can't become Hokage by simply attacking his grandfather and will need to train hard to accomplish this goal.",

Their large metal gauntlets house a retractable shuriken chain running between the two of them, which they can use to bind an enemy and then slice them to pieces. In the event that the shuriken chain is neutralized, they also have a release mechanism, to free them up for individual attacks. They use the sharp, poisoned claws on their gauntlets to shred their foes. As Kirigakure Chunin, they are renowned for their fighting resolve. ",

When his extensions are open and his head is visible, it is revealed that Zetsu has two different colored halves of his body, the left side completely white and the right side black. To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing). They also seem to communicate with their thoughts. To further his venus fly trap theme, Zetsu is a cannibal.   Zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of Pain and Tobi's identities. He has apparently been working with the latter for some time, Tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and Zetsu later commenting that Tobi's plans have been in the works for a long time.   Zetsu's main role within the Akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for Akatsuki. He has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. When an agent to Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, Zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. Zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members. Due to the role he plays, Zetsu is the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. Despite this, Zetsu serves as a sort of superior to other members, as they often report directly to him instead of the actual leader, Pain. ",

His job was to stop Idate Morino, a runner for the Wasabi clan, from winning the Todori Burning Fire Race against Shikakuya Fukusuke of the Wagarashi Clan. The story behind Aoi is much deeper though as he was a previously a Konoha Chunin. Aoi betrayed Konoha by having his student, Idate, steal two special treasures from Konoha under the false pretense of his student becoming a Chunin. These treasures were the Raijin Sword/The blade of the thunder spirit in the English dub (according to Aoi, used by the Second Hokage), and a special scroll of forbidden jutsu. After this event, Aoi defected to Amegakure but was followed by Idate's brother, Ibiki Morino, who was then, along with his younger brother Idate, captured by Aoi and tortured to translate the scroll.Only Leaf village Jounin could translate the scrolls writings. Ibiki not only resisted the torture, but managed to escape with the scroll. After this incident, Aoi remained with Amegakure upon which he became a Jonin. As a member of Amegakure he performed various odd jobs and demeaning tasks that other ninja wouldn't bother with. Aoi's skills mainly involve his umbrella and needles, which he can use to pin opponents with. His needles are commonly dipped in poison, making them even more lethal. What sets him apart from other ninja is his use of the special Raijin sword, which he stole from Konoha. Though he is fast, most of his techniques are fairly basic. At the end of the arc, Aoi's Raijin was cracked by Sasuke's Chidori and then broken by Naruto's Rasengan, he was knocked off a cliff by Naruto. It is unknown if he survived, but he himself states earlier in the episode that anyone knocked off will surely die, and unlike Sakura and Sasuke, he is unable to slow his descent at all before hitting the waters below.",

Guy, and by extension Lee, lives his life by his own \"My Rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as \"Konoha's Prideful Green Beast\".  Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi \"has to act so cool\". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.\n\n~!After his fight with Madara Uchiha, he becomes crippled and put in a wheelchair due to him breaking his bones after opening 8th gates!~",

Over time, those with \u0026quot;Advanced Blood\u0026quot; came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left. When Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku\u0026#039;s father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku\u0026#039;s fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.    On one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing.",

Chouji has a love for food, his favorite being Korean barbecue, general snacks and sweets, and basically anything that is edible. His nigh-constant hunger is a constant annoyance for his teammates, as sating himself often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. Because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. Despite his open display for his love of food, Chouji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat\". Once called \"fat\", Chouji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Chouji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Chouji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.  As an Akimichi, Chouji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size. At the series' start he uses Multi-Size Technique to serve this purpose, reshaping him into a large, round form.",

His former country, the Land of Water, now seeks him out for plotting to overthrow its government and being involved in numerous assassinations. When he was still loyal to Kirigakure, he was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of ninja that wield particularly large weapons in battle. \n\nKisame has a distinctive shark-like appearance, complete with pale blue skin, small white eyes, gill-like facial structures, and sharp triangular teeth.

His shark-like qualities carry over to the type of techniques he uses in battle, as he often shapes bodies of water into the forms of sharks that proceed to attack opponents. If there is no water source where he happens to be fighting, Kisame can use Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave to create a lake's worth of water to be used for attacks. Kisame is also noted to have a particularly large reserve of chakra; even when he fights at 30% power in one instance his chakra supply is compared to that of a Nine-Tailed Demon Fox-enhanced Naruto Uzumaki.   \n\n(Source: Naruto.com)",

Kurenai knows how Hinata is viewed by her father, even though she is technically the heiress of the clan since she is the eldest child. She is also aware of her student's infatuation for Naruto Uzumaki. When Hinata tried to offer Naruto some medicine after his fight with Kiba, Naruto was hesitant to take it. Kurenai convinced him to take it. Her personality is unyielding, honest, and simple. She also says she is a \"big sister type\".    ~! Three years later, she is pregnant with Asuma's child.!~",

        "description": "__Height__: 172 cm   \n__Rank__: Genin (I); Jonin (II)  \n\nNeji Hyuuga is a stoic member of Might Guy's Team Guy, consisting of himself, Rock Lee, and Tenten. Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji possesses the Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.  Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members.   After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.",

Gamatatsu has shown that he'd choose snacks over someone's life. When Naruto is injured while fighting with Kabuto Yakushi, he replies, \"Hey Gamakichi, do we have to wait for the kid to croak till we get snacks, cuz' I'm getting hungry\". Although in the filler arcs Gamatatsu showed that he does care about Naruto's life as he was ready to rescue him before Gamakichi talked him out of it. It should be noted that Gamatatsu appears to be the most subservient and loyal of the main frog summons as he was willing to serve Naruto before Gamakichi brought up the snack remark. While being naive and childishly stupid, he does sometimes make use of his natural curiosity to help Naruto solve puzzles (like the mystery of the Ghost Warrior in the filler arcs). Gamatatatsu's obsession for snacks is so great that he waited a year since his first summon for the snack he was promised, even though he didn't get it. He is always hungry and asking his summoner for snacks, and often gets mixed up in unusual predicaments which he counts on his \"big brother Gamakichi\" to get him out of. In the english dub, his voice is jocularly high and he is usually used for comic relief when he is summoned. He also openly refers to Gamabunta as \"daddy\", which the older toad either chooses to ignore or simply doesn't mind.",

        "description": "Pain is the recognized leader of Akatsuki, partnered to Konan, with Tobi acting as his benefactor. He is the principal figure in the tailed beast sealing ceremony.   ~!The first and leading \"Pain\" appearing in the series is actually Yahiko, one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" that are all controlled by one person's will[ch. 378, 419]: Nagato of Amegakure. At a young age, Nagato was secretly visited by Madara Uchiha who implanted his Rinnegan (lit. \"Saṃsāra Eye\") into the child's body, giving him the ability to use abilities based on the six Buddhist paths of reincarnation. Orphaned, Nagato met fellow orphans Konan and Yahiko before they are all trained by Jiraiya. Nagato desired peace for the world, aiding Yahiko to create the Akatsuki to achieve that shared dream. However, a trap laid by Amegakure's dictator Hanzo led to Yahiko's death, causing Nagato to take over as the new leader of the organization. Though the encounter crippled Nagato, the experience of having his best friend die caused Nagato to come to the realization that peace could only be attained by teaching the world the pain caused by war.  To that end he adopted the alias \"Pain\" to conquer Amegakure and invented the Six Path of Pain to overcome his handicap and kill Hanzo, becoming a \"god\" in the eyes of Amegakure's citizens. Having made cosmetically alterations to the other Paths by dying their hair to match Yahiko's, the Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation. Through Nagato's Rinnegan, they can also share visual information and coordinate attacks.  Jiraiya would later confront Nagato regarding his role as \"Pain\", the leader of Akatsuki. The two would fight with Nagato dismissing his former mentor's ideals as well as killing him. During Pain's attack on Konoha, the six Paths are defeated by Naruto. Talking with Naruto, Nagato renews his faith in his late master and in the possibility of peace. Nagato sacrifices his life in order to revive the people he killed in Konoha.[ch. 449] Nagato is later resurrected by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee, but is sent back to the afterlife.!~",

In addition to liking bugs, Shino is characterized by his emotionless, solitary, and collected way of doing things.

As a member of the Aburame clan, Shino was infused at birth with a special breed of insects that feed on chakra. In return for becoming a living hive, the insects attack opponents, usually while he distracts them, and carry out other tasks as he commands. Shino has found a number of uses for these bugs, and as such has devised a number of jutsu that utilize them for varying purposes, such as creating copies of himself or using bugs for defensive purposes.",

        "description": "__Height:__  175.2 cm\n\nNara Shikaku is the father of Shikamaru and the husband of Yoshino, and, like his son, he was part of an Ino-Shika-Cho trio, together with Choza Akimichi and Inoichi Yamanaka. Like his son, he is the Shika in the group name. As a member of the Nara clan, he raises deer, whose antlers can be used to make a medicine that halts the destructive effects of the Akimichi clan\u0026#039;s three-colored pills. Since his son became a Chuunin, Shikaku has taken a great interest in Shikamaru\u0026#039;s training as he knows his son has much greater potential than he gives himself credit, regularly playing him at shogi to further refine his son\u0026#039;s intellect and teaching him more of their clan\u0026#039;s secret techniques. \n\nHe is probably the most skilled strategist and shogi player in all of Konoha, he beats Shikamaru on a regular basis. When he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of Shikamaru\u0026#039;s catchphrases (\u0026quot;What a drag\u0026quot; in English, \u0026quot;How troublesome\u0026quot; in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. Also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. He also seems to be very smart as he has defeated Shikamaru in shogi. \n\nLike his son, and the rest of his clan, Shikaku uses a special secret clan type of Jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. Although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan\u0026#039;s techniques. Shikaku\u0026#039;s intelligence and skill as a ninja, has also earned him the position of Jounin Commander - the highest-ranking position to which a normal Shinobi can be promoted.",

        "description": "**Chakra Element:** Doton  \n**Height:** 166 cm  \n**Occupation:** Akatsuki member   \n\nDeidara is a missing-nin from Iwagakure. Before joining the Akatsuki, Deidara was a terrorist bomber for hire. His work caught the eye of Pain, who sent other Akatsuki members to recruit him. Though he refused at first, Deidara was forced to join the organization after being defeated by Itachi Uchiha. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point onward and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, who earned Deidara's admiration through his artistic ability and insight. Deidara was partnered with Tobi after Sasori's death, whom he treated as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara took great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even spent his final moments apologizing to him.  In battle, Deidara uses special mouths on the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as \"art,\" believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is to such a degree that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to a feeling of overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation that ranges anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything within a 10 kilometer radius.",

Though, this seems to have gone away as time passed by. This is most evident when he is with Gaara, who Kankuro is forced to put up with due to the fear his younger brother imposes on him. Despite their apparent differences, Gaara and Kankuro become very close over the timeskip as Gaara begins to confide in Kankuro and shares his dreams of wanting to risk his life to protect Sunagakure. As such, Kankuro has become very protective of Gaara, willing to challenge anyone who puts Gaara down in his presence. When Gaara is captured by Akatsuki, Kankuro rushes to his brother's aid in an attempt to save him and even after being nearly killed as a result he does not falter in his resolve to find Gaara.  Kankuro has shown to be a rather violent and brutal opponent, often leaving his opponents in extreme pain after battle. He is a talented puppeteer, and with each of his appearances in the major arcs is seen with a new puppet in his arsenal. The three puppets that have been introduced were all originally created by Sasori, and came into Kankuro's possession some time after the former left Sunagakure. Karasu, the first of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, has been heavily modified by Kankuro. Because of this it is highly offensive, having numerous concealed weapons and being able to detach any of its limbs for separate attacks. Kuroari, the second of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, is used to capture opponents for assassination purposes. Once an opponent is captured within it each of Kuroari's arms convert to saw-blades and slice through the confined opponent. Sanshouo, the third of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, is not seen in action in the manga. In the anime, Sanshouo is shown to have a hollow body that Kankuro can take cover in to defend against attacks. These puppets seem to be designed to work together to some degree, as Kankuro frequently uses them in tandem to increase their effectiveness. Karasu, for example, can blanket an area in smoke while Kuroari fires weapons at the blinded opponent.",

As a result, she is the one who tends to stress over details, such as Tsunade's tendency to gamble and to think with her heart. She often gets comically worked up over any irrational decision Tsunade makes. Shizune also looks after Tonton, Tsunade's pet pig.  She's not the type to tire easily and is very energetic and efficient while acting in her capacity of Hokage's Assistant, often urging Tsunade to finish the paperwork in order to avoid mountains of unsigned documents later on.

Shizune is noted to be a very talented medical ninja, in Konoha rivaled only by Tsunade herself and Sakura Haruno, another student of Tsunade's.

He refuses to give up, even at the cost of his own life.",

        "description": "The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, whose real name was recently revealed to be Kurama, is the most powerful of the tailed beasts, also considered the \"King of the Tailed Beasts\". Its power is such that it is regarded as an age-old natural disaster, as a single swipe of one of its nine tails is enough to raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. One of its special abilities is that it has access to close to unlimited sources of chakra.   The demon fox's attacks were seemingly random, the only apparent reason for its appearances being its attraction to places of human malice. It attacked Konohagakure twelve years before the start of the series. None of the ninja of the village were able to defeat it until the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, arrived to deal with it. Minato sacrificed his life to seal the fox into the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, with the Dead Demon Consuming Seal. Rather than completely seal off the fox's great power, however, Minato only sealed away a portion of it, giving Naruto access to the rest for unknown reasons. Prior to performing the seal Minato gave a key to Jiraiya to either strengthen or weaken the seal should the need arise. The seal naturally becomes weaker as the years pass, and in the event that it is broken the demon fox will be released. However, the bond between Naruto and Kyuubi, and the bond between Jinchuuriki (host) and tailed beast in general, is of a such character that if the seal is broken, Naruto will die immediately thereafter. And if Naruto dies, and the seal is not broken, Kyuubi will die with him. Therefore Kyuubi uses some of its chakra to enhance Naruto's healing abilities and will sometimes \"take over\" (lend Naruto its chakra without him asking for it) in order to keep him alive.   ~! Naruto and Kurama later become friendly, much like Killer Bee and his tailed beast, Gyuuki. This allows Naruto to finally take full control of all of Kurama's abilities, including being able to use Tailed Beast Mode. !~",

Orochimaru noted Sakon to be the fastest and strongest member of the Sound Four, traits Sakon is very proud of. When in battle Sakon likes to prolong the fight by toying with the opponent and use unnecessarily powerful techniques. This tendency of Sakon's would cause him to slow down the rest of the group whenever he got interested in an opponent..",

They also hoped the fame would bring them a ton of affection from the village women. The exact location of their village is unknown, it may be within the large Fire Country, or it may be in a neighboring non-shinobi nation.    Mondai impersonated Maito Gai when they entered the village, unable to Henge, they instead wore costumes. Kakashi met the two infiltrators and easily recognized they were fakes. He reported their presence to Tsunade who decided to have fun with them, ordering Sakura, TenTen and Katsuyu to put them through gross and labor intensive missions. They two men agreed in the hopes they could gain favor with Tsunade. Unfortunately Naruto fell for the disguise of the two men and worked alongside them as training. When the two men finally had enough, they left the village and met Gai and Lee who were returning. Lee and Gai were surprised by their impersonators. Poccha and Mondai tried to attack the two, but the real Gai and Lee easily kicked them far away, ending their fun.    ",

She seduced Jiraiya in Orochimaru\u0026#039;s lair, telling him that she was Orochimaru\u0026#039;s mistress, and lured him to a room where both of them will be crushed by the ceiling. Jiraiya managed to prevent that and she is currently living with Hanzaki Fuma and Sasame Fuma. ",

Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand.!~",

The original four were forced to accept him against their will, as Kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.  NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.  Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\n\nLike many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~! Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.!~  ",

When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (literally \"Make Out Violence\").",

After Naruto fails to graduate from the Academy, Mizuki tells Naruto that there is another way to graduate, and tricks him into stealing the forbidden scroll of sealings for him.  But as fate would have it, Mizuki shows up and pins Iruka to the wooden shack behind him. Mizuki then tells Naruto the truth about his past, the fact that he is the Demon Fox. Mizuki then attempts to kill both Naruto and Iruka, but luckily, Naruto uses the skill he learned from the scroll, Shadow Clone Jutsu, to create clones of himself which defeat Mizuki easily.  After that incident, Mizuki was imprisoned in the Konoha Strict Correctional Facility. Mizuki later on leads a prison revolt and sends the brothers, Fuujin and Raijin, to Orochimaru. During his escape, Mizuki remembers back to when Orochimaru gave him a cursed seal after a mission in which he killed his comrade. He was defeated by Naruto's Rasengan.  Mizuki is from the Village Hidden in the Leaves, and his technique is the Transformation Jutsu.",

In battle she summons varying types of weapons from the scrolls she carries with her. In Part I she has many scrolls that serve this purpose, but in Part II she has consolidated her arsenal into a single large scroll. The weapons predominately consist of steel projectiles and an assortment of close-combat weapons, though she is seen using a crossbow in the anime and even a spiked bomb in Part II.",
