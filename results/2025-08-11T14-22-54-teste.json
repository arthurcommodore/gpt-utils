              "description": "__Height:__ 179.2cm (5'10.6\")\n\nMinato Namikaze was the Fourth Hokage of Konohagakure and the man responsible for sealing the nine-tailed demon fox inside Naruto Uzumaki when he was born. Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand.!~",

              "description": "\nKimimaro was the fifth member of the Sound Four, thus temporarily changing their group name to the Sound Five. The original four were forced to accept him against their will, as Kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.  NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.  Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\n\nLike many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~! Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.!~  ",

Genma is often seen with a senbon in his mouth. He uses this as a weapon, spitting it out at the enemy to attack them, or to deflect ranged weapon attacks. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Genma battles Baki off-screen, presumably to a draw since both of them come out of the fight relatively unscathed. He later appears with Raido Namiashi to confront the Sound Four, who are forced to go level 2 of their cursed seals to defeat them. The Sound Four later comment that if it hadn't been for their cursed seals, Genma and Raido would have defeated them.",
