              "description": "Gamatatsu (ガマ竜; Literally meaning \"Toad Dragon\") is one of Gamabunta's children and Gamakichi's younger brother who has a fixation with snacks.  Gamatatsu has shown that he'd choose snacks over someone's life. When Naruto is injured while fighting with Kabuto Yakushi, he replies, \"Hey Gamakichi, do we have to wait for the kid to croak till we get snacks, cuz' I'm getting hungry\". Although in the filler arcs Gamatatsu showed that he does care about Naruto's life as he was ready to rescue him before Gamakichi talked him out of it. It should be noted that Gamatatsu appears to be the most subservient and loyal of the main frog summons as he was willing to serve Naruto before Gamakichi brought up the snack remark. While being naive and childishly stupid, he does sometimes make use of his natural curiosity to help Naruto solve puzzles (like the mystery of the Ghost Warrior in the filler arcs). Gamatatatsu's obsession for snacks is so great that he waited a year since his first summon for the snack he was promised, even though he didn't get it. He is always hungry and asking his summoner for snacks, and often gets mixed up in unusual predicaments which he counts on his \"big brother Gamakichi\" to get him out of. In the english dub, his voice is jocularly high and he is usually used for comic relief when he is summoned. He also openly refers to Gamabunta as \"daddy\", which the older toad either chooses to ignore or simply doesn't mind.",

He is the principal figure in the tailed beast sealing ceremony.   ~!The first and leading \"Pain\" appearing in the series is actually Yahiko, one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" that are all controlled by one person's will[ch. 378, 419]: Nagato of Amegakure. At a young age, Nagato was secretly visited by Madara Uchiha who implanted his Rinnegan (lit. \"Saṃsāra Eye\") into the child's body, giving him the ability to use abilities based on the six Buddhist paths of reincarnation. Orphaned, Nagato met fellow orphans Konan and Yahiko before they are all trained by Jiraiya. Nagato desired peace for the world, aiding Yahiko to create the Akatsuki to achieve that shared dream. However, a trap laid by Amegakure's dictator Hanzo led to Yahiko's death, causing Nagato to take over as the new leader of the organization. Though the encounter crippled Nagato, the experience of having his best friend die caused Nagato to come to the realization that peace could only be attained by teaching the world the pain caused by war.  To that end he adopted the alias \"Pain\" to conquer Amegakure and invented the Six Path of Pain to overcome his handicap and kill Hanzo, becoming a \"god\" in the eyes of Amegakure's citizens. Having made cosmetically alterations to the other Paths by dying their hair to match Yahiko's, the Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation. Through Nagato's Rinnegan, they can also share visual information and coordinate attacks.  Jiraiya would later confront Nagato regarding his role as \"Pain\", the leader of Akatsuki. The two would fight with Nagato dismissing his former mentor's ideals as well as killing him. During Pain's attack on Konoha, the six Paths are defeated by Naruto. Talking with Naruto, Nagato renews his faith in his late master and in the possibility of peace. Nagato sacrifices his life in order to revive the people he killed in Konoha.[ch. 449] Nagato is later resurrected by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee, but is sent back to the afterlife.!~",

Like his son, he is the Shika in the group name. As a member of the Nara clan, he raises deer, whose antlers can be used to make a medicine that halts the destructive effects of the Akimichi clan\u0026#039;s three-colored pills. Since his son became a Chuunin, Shikaku has taken a great interest in Shikamaru\u0026#039;s training as he knows his son has much greater potential than he gives himself credit, regularly playing him at shogi to further refine his son\u0026#039;s intellect and teaching him more of their clan\u0026#039;s secret techniques. \n\nHe is probably the most skilled strategist and shogi player in all of Konoha, he beats Shikamaru on a regular basis. When he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of Shikamaru\u0026#039;s catchphrases (\u0026quot;What a drag\u0026quot; in English, \u0026quot;How troublesome\u0026quot; in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. Also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. He also seems to be very smart as he has defeated Shikamaru in shogi. \n\nLike his son, and the rest of his clan, Shikaku uses a special secret clan type of Jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. Although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan\u0026#039;s techniques. Shikaku\u0026#039;s intelligence and skill as a ninja, has also earned him the position of Jounin Commander - the highest-ranking position to which a normal Shinobi can be promoted.",

Before joining the Akatsuki, Deidara was a terrorist bomber for hire. His work caught the eye of Pain, who sent other Akatsuki members to recruit him. Though he refused at first, Deidara was forced to join the organization after being defeated by Itachi Uchiha. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point onward and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, who earned Deidara's admiration through his artistic ability and insight. Deidara was partnered with Tobi after Sasori's death, whom he treated as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara took great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even spent his final moments apologizing to him.  In battle, Deidara uses special mouths on the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as \"art,\" believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is to such a degree that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to a feeling of overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation that ranges anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything within a 10 kilometer radius.",
