The series adapts material from the manga 'Eikou Naki Tensai-tachi' (Geniuses Without Glory), originally serialized in Weekly Young Jump and written by Tomoyoshi Itou and illustrated by Shingo Morita. The first episode centers on Hironoshin Furuhashi, the legendary swimmer known as the 'flying fish of Fujiyama,' and features interviews with Olympic swimmer Kousuke Kitajima and others about Furuhashi's legacy and the evolution of competitive swimming in Japan. The documentary provides a blend of animated narrative and real-life commentary, highlighting the impact of these athletes on Japanese sports culture.\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"episodes\": 2,\n  \"characters\": [],\n  \"chatGpt\": true,\n  \"chatGptDontFound\": false\n}",
