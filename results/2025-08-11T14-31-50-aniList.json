The exact location of their village is unknown, it may be within the large Fire Country, or it may be in a neighboring non-shinobi nation.    Mondai impersonated Maito Gai when they entered the village, unable to Henge, they instead wore costumes. Kakashi met the two infiltrators and easily recognized they were fakes.

They two men agreed in the hopes they could gain favor with Tsunade. Unfortunately Naruto fell for the disguise of the two men and worked alongside them as training. When the two men finally had enough, they left the village and met Gai and Lee who were returning. Lee and Gai were surprised by their impersonators.

              "description": "Under the guidance of the Second Hokage, Tobirama Senju, Koharu and her teammates, Hiruzen and Homura, completed numerous missions and became close friends. When Hiruzen became the Third Hokage, Homura and Koharu became his councilors. With their years of experience and knowledge and their unending effort to make Konohagakure a better place, they eventually gained similar respect and social status as the Hokage himself. She holds the belief that the group is more important than any of its individual members. Because of this, she always tries to do what she thinks is the best for Konoha, even if it goes against the Hokage's or her opinion. She is also quite demure, but does not let this stop her from voicing her opinion. In fact, despite this, she is one of the few people able to put the Fifth Hokage in her place when she oversteps her authority. Like Homura, she is more militant than the Hokage she served under have been, and sometimes leans more to Danzo's point of view.",

She used to be one of the many people in the Uchiha clan who encouraged Sasuke to be like his big brother, Itachi. In a short conversation with Sasuke, she does not seem to pay attention to him, not knowing how old he was. She was eventually killed by Itachi (as well as the rest of the Uchiha clan; except for Sasuke who he left alive). Sasuke referred to her as an aunt and called the man who interrupted in their conversation to save Sasuke from answering, uncle. Since she is from the Uchiha clan, she should possess the Sharingan. But this is unknown as she is not using it or mentioned using it. \n\n(Source: Narutopedia)",
