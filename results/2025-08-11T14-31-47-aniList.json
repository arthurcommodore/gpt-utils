              "description": "__Height:__ 179.2cm (5'10.6\")\n\nMinato Namikaze was the Fourth Hokage of Konohagakure and the man responsible for sealing the nine-tailed demon fox inside Naruto Uzumaki when he was born. Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand.!~",

              "description": "\nKimimaro was the fifth member of the Sound Four, thus temporarily changing their group name to the Sound Five. The original four were forced to accept him against their will, as Kimimaro's combat abilities exceeded all of their skills combined. He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.  NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.  Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\n\nLike many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~! Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.!~  ",

When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

With his parents and family now gone his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke applied to the ninja academy when he was young in order to get strong and avenge his clan by killing his brother. As he made friends on the way he forgot that this was his initial purpose. After his fight with Naruto he believes he's been wasting his time 'playing ninja' with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi.  As a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus.",

              "description": " __Height:__ 146 cm\n\nGaara was introduced in the series in Chuunin Exams arc, as a violent shinobi from Konoha's allied country, the Wind country. He came to Konoha with his siblings Temari and Kankuro, and with his mentor Baki, to participate in Chuunin exams.  From the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. Due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, Gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself.   In fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of Japanese Kanji letter \"Ai\", which stands for \"Love\". In Gaara's case, that Love was for himself, as he was \"Demon loving only himself\".  Gaara's point of view dramatically changed after a clash with Naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. Since then, Gaara always feels in debt to Naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.  Like Naruto, Gaara is a Jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, Ichibi no Shukaku. Gaara also relates to Naruto in that in his early years, Gaara was often repelled by other children, and feared by Suna's citizens due to the incredible power he possessed.",

After Naruto fails to graduate from the Academy, Mizuki tells Naruto that there is another way to graduate, and tricks him into stealing the forbidden scroll of sealings for him.  But as fate would have it, Mizuki shows up and pins Iruka to the wooden shack behind him. Mizuki then tells Naruto the truth about his past, the fact that he is the Demon Fox. Mizuki then attempts to kill both Naruto and Iruka, but luckily, Naruto uses the skill he learned from the scroll, Shadow Clone Jutsu, to create clones of himself which defeat Mizuki easily.
