They were hired by Gato to kill the Bridge Builder Tazuna, and therefor stoping the work on the bridge from the Land of Waves, making all of the Wave Country's citizens lose all their hope. They bothy attacked Tazuna, who was guarded by Team 7. After a little quick battle, they were tied up to a tree and left there. The Demon brothers are a paragon of coordination attacking. Their large metal gauntlets house a retractable shuriken chain running between the two of them, which they can use to bind an enemy and then slice them to pieces. In the event that the shuriken chain is neutralized, they also have a release mechanism, to free them up for individual attacks. They use the sharp, poisoned claws on their gauntlets to shred their foes. As Kirigakure Chunin, they are renowned for their fighting resolve. ",

              "description": "Zetsu is easily distinguished by two large venus fly trap-like extensions enveloping his head and upper body, giving him a plant-like appearance. When his extensions are open and his head is visible, it is revealed that Zetsu has two different colored halves of his body, the left side completely white and the right side black. To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing). They also seem to communicate with their thoughts. To further his venus fly trap theme, Zetsu is a cannibal.   Zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of Pain and Tobi's identities. He has apparently been working with the latter for some time, Tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and Zetsu later commenting that Tobi's plans have been in the works for a long time.   Zetsu's main role within the Akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for Akatsuki. He has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. When an agent to Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, Zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. Zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members. Due to the role he plays, Zetsu is the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. Despite this, Zetsu serves as a sort of superior to other members, as they often report directly to him instead of the actual leader, Pain. ",

His job was to stop Idate Morino, a runner for the Wasabi clan, from winning the Todori Burning Fire Race against Shikakuya Fukusuke of the Wagarashi Clan. The story behind Aoi is much deeper though as he was a previously a Konoha Chunin. Aoi betrayed Konoha by having his student, Idate, steal two special treasures from Konoha under the false pretense of his student becoming a Chunin. These treasures were the Raijin Sword/The blade of the thunder spirit in the English dub (according to Aoi, used by the Second Hokage), and a special scroll of forbidden jutsu. After this event, Aoi defected to Amegakure but was followed by Idate's brother, Ibiki Morino, who was then, along with his younger brother Idate, captured by Aoi and tortured to translate the scroll.Only Leaf village Jounin could translate the scrolls writings. Ibiki not only resisted the torture, but managed to escape with the scroll. After this incident, Aoi remained with Amegakure upon which he became a Jonin. As a member of Amegakure he performed various odd jobs and demeaning tasks that other ninja wouldn't bother with. Aoi's skills mainly involve his umbrella and needles, which he can use to pin opponents with. His needles are commonly dipped in poison, making them even more lethal. What sets him apart from other ninja is his use of the special Raijin sword, which he stole from Konoha. Though he is fast, most of his techniques are fairly basic. At the end of the arc, Aoi's Raijin was cracked by Sasuke's Chidori and then broken by Naruto's Rasengan, he was knocked off a cliff by Naruto. It is unknown if he survived, but he himself states earlier in the episode that anyone knocked off will surely die, and unlike Sakura and Sasuke, he is unable to slow his descent at all before hitting the waters below.",

Guy, and by extension Lee, lives his life by his own \"My Rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as \"Konoha's Prideful Green Beast\".  Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi \"has to act so cool\". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.\n\n~!After his fight with Madara Uchiha, he becomes crippled and put in a wheelchair due to him breaking his bones after opening 8th gates!~",

She lost all hope after her brother died, and nearly committed suicide, but Sagi's spirit stopped her, and gave her his stopped pocket watch, symbolizing her inability to move past the loss. She posed as her brother Sagi as the daimyo, and assumed the identity as the Cursed Warrior in order to kill Moso, the person who had assassinated her brother and father. Toki attempted to attack Oki, but was defeated, and resigned herself to death, seeing that she was unable to take revenge. Naruto, however, arrived and convinced her to live on for the sake of the Land of Birds before defeating Oki. After Oki's defeat, Toki's watch began moving forward again, symbolizing her ability to move on. The next day, Toki revealed her deception and apologized to the people of the land, but asked to be allowed to continue ruling the land to help restore it to its peaceful nature. The people forgave her and she continued to rule as Toki. ",

Over time, those with \u0026quot;Advanced Blood\u0026quot; came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left. When Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku\u0026#039;s father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku\u0026#039;s fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.    On one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing.",

Together with him Ino Yamanaka, and Asuma Sarutobi they make team 10. Chouji has a love for food, his favorite being Korean barbecue, general snacks and sweets, and basically anything that is edible. His nigh-constant hunger is a constant annoyance for his teammates, as sating himself often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. Because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. Despite his open display for his love of food, Chouji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat\". Once called \"fat\", Chouji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Chouji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Chouji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.  As an Akimichi, Chouji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size. At the series' start he uses Multi-Size Technique to serve this purpose, reshaping him into a large, round form.",

He gets along considerably better with Itachi than most Akatsuki members do with their own partners, immediately doing as Itachi asks of him and always looking out for Itachi's well-being. His former country, the Land of Water, now seeks him out for plotting to overthrow its government and being involved in numerous assassinations. When he was still loyal to Kirigakure, he was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of ninja that wield particularly large weapons in battle. \n\nKisame has a distinctive shark-like appearance, complete with pale blue skin, small white eyes, gill-like facial structures, and sharp triangular teeth. Even his name, Kisame, means \"demon shark\". His shark-like qualities carry over to the type of techniques he uses in battle, as he often shapes bodies of water into the forms of sharks that proceed to attack opponents. If there is no water source where he happens to be fighting, Kisame can use Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave to create a lake's worth of water to be used for attacks. Kisame is also noted to have a particularly large reserve of chakra; even when he fights at 30% power in one instance his chakra supply is compared to that of a Nine-Tailed Demon Fox-enhanced Naruto Uzumaki.   \n\n(Source: Naruto.com)",
