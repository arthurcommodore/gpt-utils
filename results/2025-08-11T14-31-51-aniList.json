Orochimaru taught her how to play a Koto. She also demonstrated an ability to extend her hair around an opponent.    She seduced Jiraiya in Orochimaru\u0026#039;s lair, telling him that she was Orochimaru\u0026#039;s mistress, and lured him to a room where both of them will be crushed by the ceiling. Jiraiya managed to prevent that and she is currently living with Hanzaki Fuma and Sasame Fuma. ",
